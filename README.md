# SOLID
# Summary
# Single Responsibility Principle
A class should only have one reason to change;
Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems.
# Open-Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
# Liskov Substitution Principle
You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
# Interface segregation Principle
Don't put too much into an interface;
Split into separate interfaces;
YAGNI - You ain't going to need it.
# Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones;
Use abstractions.
